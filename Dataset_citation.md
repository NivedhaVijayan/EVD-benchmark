### 8. DuckDuckGo Educational Image Collection

* **Description:** Curated educational diagrams and figure samples sourced via DuckDuckGo image search for category balancing.
* **Access:** [https://duckduckgo.com/](https://duckduckgo.com/)
* ‚úÖ Method: Searches DuckDuckGo images for a given query (e.g., ‚Äúeducational diagrams math‚Äù), downloads top results into a local folder, respecting safe search and timeout rules.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes: Downloads are limited (<500 per query). Only derived features or annotations are used; images are not redistributed publicly.
* **Example code to download images from DuckDuckGo**:

```python
pip install duckduckgo-search

from duckduckgo_search import DDGS
import requests, os

query = "educational diagrams math"
output_dir = "duckduckgo_images"
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

with DDGS() as ddgs:
    results = ddgs.images(keywords=query, max_results=20)
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        url = result["image"]
        try:
            img_data = requests.get(url, timeout=5).content
            with open(f"{output_dir}/{query.replace(' ','_')}_{i}.jpg", "wb") as f:
                f.write(img_data)
            print(f"Downloaded: {url}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to download {url}: {e}")
```
